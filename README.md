### Hello, world! 

I'm soyboy, a senior solutions engineer, with a background as a full-stack dev, and a B.S. with a major in computer science. I'm facinated by crypto-economies and how they're unlocking different ways for humans to coordinate. My goal is to use my Ethereum engineering skills to become self sustainable by providing Ethereum public (and private) services.
